# CvFy

CvFy is a simple CV maker that makes CV creation faster and easier in both English and Spanish. 

It's built with NuxtJs and deployed in Netlify. 

I usually enjoy styling from scratch but this time I've used TailwindCSS for the first time to see what all the fuss was about. 

PDF creation is client-side only, so results may differ among  browsers. Chrome desktop gives has the best print as the PDF created is exactly as the preview one.

It's also a PWA so it can be used offline.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
